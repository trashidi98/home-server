# Welcome to the Home Server Page

This page should grow with time from software, concepts and issues that I face when launching applications on my home server.


## Links

A huge page of ideas from Linode lots of servers to launch: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/

Here's a whole website dedicated to things you can launch at home, this specific one is dedicated to docker webserver: https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-2-docker-tutorial/ this one describes the backbone for the whole media server (self hosting music, TV shows, etc).
